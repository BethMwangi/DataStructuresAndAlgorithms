## Arrays

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements. The two key items in an array is an  *element* and *index* . The element is identified by its index.
There are one or more dimentional arrays, e,g One-dimentional-array, two-dimentional-array

### One-dimentional-array 
one-dimentional-array is also known as a linear array.

        Array         | 5 | 7 | 3 | 1 | 6 | 9 | 2 |
        index           0   1   2   3   4   5   6


    The length of array is 7. len(Array) = 7 in python. This is the total number of elements in the Array.
    Index always starts at 0 with the first element represented as Array[0] = 5. 
    Indexes Array[1] = 7, Array[2] = 3, and so on...
