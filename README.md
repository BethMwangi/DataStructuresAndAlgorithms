# DataStructuresAndAlgorithms

### What is this project about?
Data structures is a key fundamental tool in computer science and describes different ways in how to store data. In this project, I will implement an cover the algorithms and data structures in Python with a mix of theory and code implementation.
The project is entirely for my personal preference and knowledge refresher course. 

### What will I cover?

1. Arrays
2. Linked List
3. Trees
    * Binary Tree
    * Binary Search Tree
    * Hash Table
    * Graph
4. Sorting Algorithms 
5. The list will be added along the way :simple_smile: :simple_smile:
